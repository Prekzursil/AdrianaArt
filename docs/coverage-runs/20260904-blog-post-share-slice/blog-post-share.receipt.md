## Specs

1. `focalPosition` clamps/defaults (0..100 / 50-50)
2. `shareWhatsApp` opens `wa.me` with stubbed window (`open` + listener APIs)
3. `shareFacebook` opens Facebook sharer URL

## Notes

Contact twin INNER-saturated. Continues blog miss-density after #710 (author/cover/lightbox). Distinct share/focal slice.
Done predicate: INNER and LANE_OUTER(outer:blocked) and REPO_VERIFY and Review, then draft PR.

- DeSlop `bc-b83712b0`: PASS (N=3 real branches)
- Council: CONDITIONAL — cannot AGREE Done until draft PR exists
